# Programming-Poetry-Project

This project analyzes a dataset that contains poems by older English authors. The dataset contains the names of the authors, the names of the poems, the contents of the poems, the ages in which they were written (Renaissance or Modern), and the genres that each poem belong to (Love, Nature, Mythology & Folklore). We appended a gender column that contains the gender of each author.

These are the main types of information that we were interested in analyzing, as well as the chosen visual that we chose to represent our findings in:

Ages - Pie Graph
Genre Types - Bar Graph
Gender - Bar Graph
Genre per Age - Stacked Column Chart
Length of Poems by Genre - Box Plots
Most Used Words - Word Cloud
NLTK Sentiment Analysis

Our code that processes and cleans the data, as well as generates visuals can be found in the main.ipynb file.
Images of our visualizations are in the Images directory.
Our Resources directory contains the Poetry_Analysis_Data.csv file which contains our dataset.

More information regarding our findings can be found in the presentation.
